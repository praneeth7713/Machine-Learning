# Getting Started

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.7 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
Necessary Python packages


Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/MyMachineLearning.git
cd MyMachineLearning


Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing stage involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing the raw data for modeling. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Steps
Load Data
Clean Data: Remove or impute missing values.
Transform Data: Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features.
Save Processed Data: Save the processed data to the data/processed/ directory.


Model Building
This stage involves selecting and building the machine learning model. The chosen model will be trained using the processed data.

Steps
Select Model: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm.
Build Model: Define the model architecture.
Compile Model: Configure the model for training.
Running Model Building
You can explore model building in the Jupyter notebook:


Training and Evaluation
After building the model, we train it using the training data and evaluate its performance on a test set.

Steps
Split Data: Split the processed data into training and testing sets.
Train Model: Train the model on the training set.
Evaluate Model: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using relevant metrics.
Running Training and Evaluation
You can perform training and evaluation in the Jupyter notebook:


Results
The results section provides an overview of the model's performance, including key metrics and visualizations. Detailed results can be found in the results/ directory.
